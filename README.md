# Drone-Based Intelligent Agriculture System

## ðŸš€ Overview

The **Drone-Based Intelligent Agriculture System** is an advanced precision farming solution that leverages drones, computer vision, machine learning, and IoT to monitor crop health, detect diseases, spray pesticides, and analyze field data in real time. This system enhances productivity, reduces manual labor, and promotes sustainable farming practices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Disease & Pest Detection**: Uses ML models to identify leaf diseases and pest infestations from aerial images.
- **Smart Spraying System**: Automatically sprays pesticides only in infected areas, minimizing chemical usage.
- **Nutrient Monitoring**: Integrates with sensors (NPK, temperature, humidity) on-ground or on robotic carts to assess soil and crop health.
- **Mission Planning**: Autonomous drone flight over predefined paths using mission planner tools.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Visualizes health statistics, detection reports, GPS paths, and system alerts.
- **Edge Deployment**: Lightweight models deployed on embedded systems like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
- **Emergency Alert System**: Notifies farmers about critical issues like low nutrient levels, infections, or pest outbreaks.
